                    <h5>1. No Cheating Or Exploiting</h5>
                    <p>
                        Any form of cheating or exploiting will result in instant punishment we have zero tolerance on this.
                        Exceptions to this rule is mek swiping (we have no control over this and is sometimes necessary for
                        attacking certain spots for example rat holes and crouch spots). Mesh biting is a no as this is too controversial.

                    <h5>2. No Racism or Excessive Toxicity</h5>
                    <p>
                        Racism and toxicity in the chat is unacceptable and you can be punished for this. Banter and fighting talk is ok of course and we encourage this.

                    <p>
                        Your survivor and tribe name has to be unique. No usage of 123, 123456789, Human, smiley faces, invisible,
                        odd characters etc. An admin will change this manually if you do not and we get creative so be sensible.

                    <h5>4. Same Tribe Across Cluster</h5>
                    <p>
                        You must be in the same tribe across the cluster, you may leave your tribe to join another to assist them with
                        raiding or defending but once again you must be in that same tribe across the cluster and we make no exceptions.

                    <h5>5. No Line of Sight Exploiting</h5>
                    <p>
                        Exploiting line of sight bugs (tunnel building using XL walls is an example of this) is considered cheating/exploiting
                        and will be dealt with accordingly. The same applies for tunnel building on platforms.

                    <h5>6. No Griefing</h5>
                    <p>
                        Griefing someone is not ok, this is a form of bullying and we will not tolerate it.
                        Harassing someone every single day in chat, purposely killing all their dinos daily without the intention of raiding them,
                        raiding them every other day, the list goes on. Other examples are, spamming structures preventing someone building while you or them have NPP purposely or fobbing someone while you or them have NPP. Killing fresh spawns and new players, camping fresh spawn points.
                        If you think someone is griefing please create a ticket on discord and explain the situation.

                    <h5>7. No Causing Lag / Affecting Server Performance</h5>
                    <p>
                        Anyone caught doing anything that affects server performance and causes massive lag will be dealt with, examples are
                        (mass stacking dinos on a single spot, mass soaking etc etc)

                    <h5>8. No Insiding</h5>
                    <p>
                        Insiding is a shitty move. However it is 100% your responsibility who you allow into your tribe and what level of access
                        you give them. Anything you farm/tame/build with your time spent in that tribe belongs to that tribe, you may not take
                        these things with you. If you want to report a situation where someone has insided you please create a ticket, however as
                        a warning we wont always take action as once again it is your responsibility who you allow into your tribe. The same also
                        applies in reverse, as an example, if you join a tribe and the tribe leader kicks you without reason and such, we cant do anything about this.

                    <p>
                        You may build anywhere (including artifact caves) apart from near/at obelisks and player spawns. Building random turret structures
                        around the map is also not allowed. Rat hole building is ok as long as it is raidable/soakable using dinos. You must not glitch into
                        spots to build we can ban or/and tribe wipe you for this! Please do not build into texture glitches on the map. These are classed as
                        under meshing and will be dealt with at admin discretion.

                    <p>
                        No excessive spamming of structures around your base. If an admin makes a request for you to reduce spam, please comply. Spamming thousands
                        of foundations is just silly and only creates client and server performance issues with render.

                    <p>
                        Do not use the invisible setting on structures you can be structure wiped for this (examples are opening every side of vacuums to make
                        floating towers under water although this is allowed INSIDE your underwater base of course). At least one side of the vacuum must be
                        closed so it can be destroyed. You can make floating vacuum towers underwater we allow these but once again none must be invisible.

                        2 bases per tribe allowed per map, however, only 1 may be inside of a cave. Breeding locations are also classed as bases. Any structures
                        inside a cave = base.

                    <p>
                        You must not block someone building if you or them have npp, examples are spamming structures despite someone already claiming a spot which
                        would prevent them building.

                    <p>
                        Spamming down foundations will claim you a spot but if someone requests removal of these to readily build in this spot an admin will remove these
                        so the player/tribe can build. Try and build at least a starter base in this spot to avoid this happening.

                    <p>
                        No turrets at fresh player spawns, this is a form of griefing. The same applies for troll public tp (free loot etc) to murder people with turrets,
                        turrets at drops, random placed turrets serving no purpose other than to grief etc. Admins will delete these if we think they are used for griefing,
                        if its excessive we will tribe wipe all your structures YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED..

                    <p>
                        Hidden teleporters inside someone’s cave is a no, this will only have the tribe accuse you of under mesh and so creates time consuming work for admins and
                        could result in your tribe getting banned if we suspect undermeshing to raid.

                        Destroy your FOB after you are done with them! If an admin has to do this we may use a
                        command which will wipe all your structures, you have been warned!! Fobs left at someones
                        base for more than 24 hours without action must be removed (the defender can request an admin remove these if you do not).

                    <h5>2. Do Not Raid The Same Tribe Twice In 24 Hours</h5>
                    <p>
                        Do not attempt to raid the same person twice in a 24 hour period, this is considered griefing. Give them time to lick their wounds. Be reasonable!
                        Once you retreat you may not attempt another attack for 24 hours. You may leave your fob there when you go offline in the middle of a raid but
                        remember if it gets destroyed you can’t attack for 24 hours. The ONLY exception to this rule is that if someone runs with loot during a raid
                        the 24 hour rule can be ignored, or if the tribe you tried to raid firstly tries to raid you back within the 24 hours, at this point the 24
                        rule is null and can be ignored.

                        Mass soaking is not allowed, 5 dinos soaking turrets at once per raid is the maximum allowed. Anyone caught breaking this rule will be
                        punished for causing unnecessary server performance issues. For this rule to be broken the dinos must actively be soaking the turrets.

                        1 tribe vs 1 tribe. If we suspect that a friend of yours is countering someone fobbing you then we will punish you or them or both,
